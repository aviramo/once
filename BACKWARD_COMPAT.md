# Backward-compat cleanup queue

Tracks server-side shims kept alive only to support older published mobile builds. Each entry is a piece of code or schema that should be removed once the minimum live app version has moved past the cutoff.

See `CLAUDE.md` → "Backward compatibility with the deployed mobile app (production)" for the staging pattern (Expand → Migrate → Contract). Entries here are the **Contract** step waiting to happen.

## How to use this file

- **When you ship the Expand step** of a breaking change, add an entry here in the same change. If you don't, the cleanup will never happen.
- **When you start a session**, scan this file: any entry whose `Safe to remove after` version is now below the live floor can be removed.
- **When you remove an entry**, delete its section from this file in the same commit.

## Entry template

```
### <short title>

- **Added:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Reason:** what breaking change this shim is bridging
- **Old shape (kept alive):** <field / endpoint / RPC / behavior the old app still relies on>
- **New shape (preferred):** <what the new app uses>
- **Safe to remove after:** mobile version >= X.Y.Z is the floor across live users
- **How to remove:**
  - <file:line or RPC name> — what to delete
  - <migration / SQL needed>
  - <any data backfill needed>
- **Verify before removing:** how to confirm no live reader is on the old shape (e.g., grep `log` table for endpoint hits, check version distribution)
