-- A BUILT PROFILE IS TWO PHOTOS AND NOTHING ELSE (user directive 2026-07-31).
--
-- The bio stopped being required: onboarding finishes with the field empty and
-- the profile preview's inline editor can clear a bio back to null. What makes
-- a profile complete is the photo count alone, and that number is stated in
-- three places which must agree — mobile's selectProfileBuilt, profileComplete
-- in supabase/functions/app/index.ts, and the only_available image filter in
-- this function, which was the odd one out at >= 1.
--
-- Body is otherwise byte-identical to the live definition; the only change is
-- the image-count line inside the only_available block.
